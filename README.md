# Agentic Landing Page Template

> **"When AI can do anything for you, what will you build?"**

A production-ready landing page template that teaches AI-assisted cloud development. Go from `git clone` to a live deployed site using natural language prompts and container commands.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and an AI coding assistant ([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)).

> **Zero host installation:** You do NOT need Node.js, npm, or any other dev tools on your machine. Everything runs inside the Docker container.

**Tell your AI agent:**
```
"Clone the landing-page repo, start the dev container, and open localhost:3000"
```

Then customize with natural language:
```
"Update the hero section with my name 'Your Name' and title 'Your Title'"
```

**CLI Reference:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pingwu/landing-page.git
cd landing-page
npm run docker:dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Version | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Next.js | 16 | React framework with App Router |
| React | 19 | Component-based UI |
| TypeScript | 5.9 | Type safety (strict mode) |
| Tailwind CSS | 4 | Utility-first styling |
| Vitest | 4 | Unit and component testing |
| Docker | — | Containerized development |
| AWS App Runner | — | Cloud deployment |

## Use Cases

The default template works for consulting services, professional portfolios, digital resumes, and enterprise initiative sites. Alternative templates are in `templates/`.

## Container Commands

**Important for AI agents:** `npm run docker:dev` already runs the container in detached mode with hot-reload enabled. The dev server starts automatically - do NOT run additional `npm run dev` commands inside the container.

| Natural Language | CLI Command | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| "Start the dev server" | `npm run docker:dev` | Dev server with hot-reload (port 3000) - runs in background |
| "Start a production preview" | `npm run docker:prod` | Production preview (port 3001) |
| "Stop the containers" | `npm run docker:down` | Stop containers |
| "Open a shell in the container" | `npm run docker:shell` | Shell into container |
| "Show the container logs" | `docker compose logs dev -f` | View logs (follow mode) |
| "Run the tests" | `docker compose exec dev npm run test:run` | Run tests |
| "Type-check the project" | `docker compose exec dev npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| "Lint the code" | `docker compose exec dev npm run lint` | ESLint |

### Correct Workflow
```bash
npm run docker:dev          # Start (runs in background automatically)
# Server is now running at http://localhost:3000
docker compose logs dev -f  # View logs if needed (optional)
npm run docker:down         # Stop when done
```

### What NOT to do
❌ `docker compose run --rm dev npm run dev` - This is redundant and blocks the terminal

## Production Graduation Checklist

Before exposing this app to real users or real traffic, confirm **every item below**.

### Runtime Safety

- Global error boundary is implemented (`app/error.tsx`)
- 404 handling is explicit (`app/not-found.tsx`)
- App does not crash on unexpected runtime errors
- Users never see raw stack traces

### Configuration Safety

- All required environment variables are validated at startup
- Missing or invalid config causes a clear, immediate failure
- No secrets are referenced in client components

### Deployment Signals

- `/health` endpoint returns `200 OK`
- Cloud platform health checks are configured
- Failed deploys are detectable without inspecting logs

### Security Baseline

- Security headers are explicitly set (CSP, frame, content-type, referrer)
- Dependencies are locked (`npm ci`)
- No credentials are committed or logged

### UX & Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation works end-to-end
- Mobile navigation opens and closes reliably
- No major layout shift on page load
- At least one accessibility test runs in CI

### Build & Release Confidence

- Production build runs successfully (`npm run docker:prod`)
- Tests pass in the same container used for production
- Target platform is explicit (`linux/amd64`)
- Rollback strategy is understood (even if manual)

### Documentation Honesty

- README clearly states what the app does **not** include
- Deployment steps exist for at least one platform
- Ownership is clear if the site breaks
