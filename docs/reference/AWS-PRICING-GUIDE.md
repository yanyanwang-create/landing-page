## AWS Pricing Philosophy

### Pay-As-You-Go

AWS charges you only for what you use. No upfront costs, no long-term contracts (unless you choose them for discounts).

**The Good**:
- Start small, scale as needed
- No wasted capacity
- Experiment without commitment

**The Risk**:
- Costs can grow unexpectedly
- Easy to forget resources running
- Auto-scaling can surprise you

### Three Core Pricing Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Compute** | CPU time and memory used | EC2 hours, Lambda invocations |
| **Storage** | Data stored | S3 GB-months, EBS volumes |
| **Data Transfer** | Data moving in/out of AWS | Downloads, cross-region traffic |

**Key insight**: Data INTO AWS is usually free. Data OUT of AWS costs money.

---

## Pricing Models

### 1. On-Demand (Pay-As-You-Go)

**How it works**: Pay by the hour or second with no commitment.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No upfront cost | Highest per-unit price |
| Stop anytime | Unpredictable monthly bills |
| Perfect for testing | Not cost-effective long-term |

**Best for**: Development, testing, unpredictable workloads, short-term projects.

---

### 2. Reserved Instances / Savings Plans

**How it works**: Commit to 1 or 3 years of usage for 30-70% discount.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Significant savings | Upfront commitment |
| Predictable costs | Locked into specific resources |
| Can pay upfront for more savings | Wasted if needs change |

**Best for**: Production workloads with predictable, steady usage.

---

### 3. Spot Instances (EC2 only)

**How it works**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount. AWS can terminate with 2-minute notice.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Up to 90% discount | Can be interrupted |
| Great for batch jobs | Not for critical workloads |
| Available immediately | Availability varies |

**Best for**: Batch processing, data analysis, CI/CD pipelines, fault-tolerant workloads.

---

### 4. Per-Request Pricing

**How it works**: Pay per API call or request (Lambda, API Gateway, Bedrock).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Pay only when used | Costs scale with traffic |
| Zero cost when idle | Can spike unexpectedly |
| Great for variable traffic | Need to monitor closely |

**Best for**: APIs, serverless applications, AI/ML inference.

---

## AWS Free Tier

AWS offers three types of free usage:

### 1. Always Free

Services that are always free within limits:

| Service | Free Limit |
|---------|------------|
| Lambda | 1M requests/month, 400,000 GB-seconds |
| DynamoDB | 25 GB storage, 25 read/write units |
| SNS | 1M publishes/month |
| CloudWatch | 10 custom metrics, 10 alarms |

### 2. 12-Month Free (New Accounts Only)

Free for 12 months after account creation:

| Service | Free Limit |
|---------|------------|
| EC2 | 750 hours/month (t2.micro or t3.micro) |
| S3 | 5 GB storage |
| RDS | 750 hours/month (db.t2.micro) |
| CloudFront | 50 GB data transfer |

### 3. Trials

Short-term free trials for specific services:

| Service | Trial |
|---------|-------|
| SageMaker | 250 hours for 2 months |
| Bedrock | Limited free tier for some models |
| App Runner | No free tier — requires service activation in the AWS Console |

**Important**: App Runner has NO free tier and requires service activation in the AWS Console (one-time per region). Minimum instance is 1 vCPU / 2 GB. Budget ~$5-15/month.

---

## Cost Management Tools

### Cost Explorer

**What it is**: Dashboard showing your AWS spending — accessible via natural language, CLI, or web console.

**Natural Language (Recommended)**:
```
"Show me my AWS costs for this month"
"Which AWS service is costing me the most?"
"How much will I spend this month? Show the forecast."
```

**CLI Reference**:
```bash
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2026-01-01,End=2026-01-31 \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

**Key Features**:

| Feature | What It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| **Cost by Service** | Which services cost the most |
| **Cost by Region** | Spending in each AWS region |
| **Daily/Monthly Trends** | How costs change over time |
| **Forecasts** | Predicted costs for the month |
| **Savings Recommendations** | Ways to reduce spending |

**Console fallback**: AWS Console → search "Cost Explorer" → click in left sidebar.

---

### CUR (Cost and Usage Reports)

**What it is**: Detailed, line-by-line export of all AWS charges.

**When to use it**:
- Enterprise cost allocation
- Chargeback to departments
- Custom analytics and reporting
- Integration with third-party tools

**Natural Language (Recommended)**:
```
"Set up a Cost and Usage Report that delivers to an S3 bucket"
```

**CLI Reference**:
```bash
aws cur put-report-definition --report-definition '{...}'
```

**Console fallback** (one-time setup): Billing Console → "Cost & Usage Reports" → Create report with S3 delivery → Query with Athena.

**For beginners**: Cost Explorer is sufficient. CUR is for advanced analysis.

---

### AWS Budgets

**What it is**: Set spending limits and get alerts before you exceed them.

**Natural Language (Recommended)**:
```
"Create a $20 monthly AWS budget with email alerts at 80% and 100% thresholds"
```

**CLI Reference**:
```bash
aws budgets create-budget --account-id <ACCOUNT_ID> \
  --budget '{"BudgetName":"MonthlyLimit","BudgetLimit":{"Amount":"20","Unit":"USD"},"TimeUnit":"MONTHLY","BudgetType":"COST"}' \
  --notifications-with-subscribers '[{"Notification":{"NotificationType":"FORECASTED","ComparisonOperator":"GREATER_THAN","Threshold":80},"Subscribers":[{"SubscriptionType":"EMAIL","Address":"you@email.com"}]}]'
```

**Console fallback**: Billing → Budgets → Create Budget → Cost Budget → $20 → Add email alert.

**Recommended Alerts**:
| Alert Type | Threshold | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Forecasted | 80% of budget | Early warning |
| Actual | 100% of budget | You've hit your limit |
| Actual | 150% of budget | Something may be wrong |

---

### AWS Pricing Calculator

**What it is**: Estimate costs before you deploy.

**Website**: https://calculator.aws/

**How to use**:
1. Add services you plan to use
2. Configure instance sizes, storage, etc.
3. Get monthly estimate

**Example for Landing Page**:
```
App Runner:
- 1 instance, 1 vCPU, 2 GB (minimum)
- Estimated: $5-15/month

ECR:
- 1 GB storage
- Estimated: $0.10/month

Total: ~$5-15/month
```

---

## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Use the Right Region

| Region | Typical Cost | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **us-east-2 (Ohio)** | Lowest | Recommended for cost |
| **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)** | Low | Most services available |
| **us-west-2 (Oregon)** | Medium | Good for West Coast |
| **eu-west-1 (Ireland)** | Higher | Best for EU users |

---

### 2. Right-Size Your Resources

**For a landing page**:

| Resource | Recommended | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| App Runner CPU | 1 vCPU | App Runner minimum (no 0.25 vCPU option exists) |
| App Runner Memory | 2 GB | App Runner minimum (no 0.5 GB option exists) |
| ECR Images | 1-2 tags | Delete old images |

**Natural Language**:
```
"Deploy to App Runner with minimum resources: 1 vCPU and 2 GB memory"
```

---

### 3. Enable Auto-Pause (App Runner)

App Runner can pause when there's no traffic, reducing costs to near zero.

| Natural Language | CLI Command |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Enable auto-pause for my App Runner service" | Update service configuration with auto-scaling min=0 |

---

### 4. Delete Unused Resources

**Weekly cleanup checklist**:

| Check | Natural Language |
|-------|-----------------|
| Unused ECR images | "Delete old Docker images from ECR, keep only latest" |
| Stopped App Runner services | "List all my App Runner services" |
| Unattached EBS volumes | "List unattached EBS volumes" |
| Old snapshots | "List EBS snapshots older than 30 days" |

---

### 5. Set Up Billing Alerts

**Minimum recommended alerts**:

| Alert | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly forecast | $10 | Email notification |
| Actual spend | $15 | Email + investigate |
| Actual spend | $25 | Email + auto-action (stop resources) |

---

## Setting Up Billing Alerts

### Using AWS Budgets (Recommended)

**Natural Language**:
```
"Create a $20 monthly AWS budget with email alerts at 80% and 100% thresholds"
```

Your AI agent will use the `aws budgets create-budget` CLI to set this up. See the [AWS Budgets](#aws-budgets) section above for the CLI reference.

### Using CloudWatch Billing Alarms

**Natural Language**:
```
"Create a CloudWatch billing alarm that notifies me when estimated charges exceed $15"
```

**CLI Reference**:
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name BillingAlert \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 21600 \
  --threshold 15 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>
```
