# Production Dockerfile — multi-stage build for Next.js standalone
# Produces a minimal image (~150MB) for Cloud Run / App Runner
#
# LESSONS LEARNED:
# 1. Builder needs ALL deps (npm ci, not --omit=dev) because next.config.ts
#    requires TypeScript at build time.
# 2. COPY fails hard on missing sources. Use glob pattern (publi[c]) to make
#    optional copies that skip silently when the directory doesn't exist.
# 3. Cloud Run / App Runner require linux/amd64. On Apple Silicon, build with:
#      docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <tag> .
# 4. Always test locally with `npm run docker:prod` before pushing to the cloud.
# 5. App Runner overrides the HOSTNAME env var with the EC2 internal hostname.
#    Use shell-form CMD to force HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 at runtime, otherwise Next.js
#    binds to the wrong interface and health checks fail.

# Stage 1: Build the application (needs ALL deps — TypeScript is required
# to transpile next.config.ts even though it's a devDependency)
